  computers running Microsoft Windows. Others vendors implementing SMB are Samba, MacOS..
  SMB was also known as Common Internet File <a href='#operations-tag-system'>System</a> (CIFS).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An SMB server is created each time Windows shares are enabled on the NAS server.
  An SMB server could be created as a standalone server or as a server that belongs to a
  Windows domain (Active Directory). In that case, DNS must be enabled on the NAS server.
  The credentials of an administrator of the domain are required to join that domain.
  An NTP server must be defined also, to prevent authentication errors caused by

- name: "dnsServer"
  description: "Domain Name <a href='#operations-tag-system'>System</a> (DNS) settings.
  <p/>
  A Domain Name <a href='#operations-tag-system'>System</a> (DNS) is a hierarchical <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> responsible for converting
  domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> uses DNS services
  to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs
  (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts
  addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.
  <p/>
  During the initial <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> configuration process you must specify the network
  address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses.
  Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.
  <p/>
  You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP
  address of the DNS servers for the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> to use. By default, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> uses
  the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list
  provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes
  unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the
  <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also
  specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>
  will use first.
  <p/>
  DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is
  identified by a domain identifier.
  <p/>
  <b>Important:</b> You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in
  the domain for the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt
  network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt
  communication between the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> and the hosts that use its storage resources."

  description: "Information about the EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS) configuration<br/>
  <br/>
  Unity Remote Support is enabled with the Dell&#8217;s leading remote
  support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote
  monitoring and support
  <a href='#operations-tag-feature'>feature</a> that provides authorized personnel with Dell remote access capabilities
  to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure
  tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> and
  systems on the Dell network can be used to transfer files out
  to the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> or back to Dell.<br/>
  <br/>
  ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end
  remote support solution:<br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Automation - IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis
  and repair of potential problems before an impact to business
  operations is noticed.</li>
  <li>Authentication - Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit
  <a href='#operations-tag-encryption'>encryption</a> and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.</li>
  <li>Authorization - Customizable policies that you control include
  the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions.</li>
  <li>Audit - Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory
  and internal business requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  ESRS offers two remote support solutions:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated
  into the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> to connect with Dell</li>
  <li>Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition
  (ESRS V3) to connect with Dell</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Setting up Remote Support requires:
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>An installed Dell Support <a href='#operations-tag-license'>license</a></li>
  <li>Valid support credentials</li>
  <li>A configured DNS server</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the
  support website.<br/>
  Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the <a href='#operations-tag-supportProxy'>supportProxy</a>
  object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName
   are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;isEsrsVeEulaAccepted&quot; : &quot;true&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 2: Update contact infomation in <a href='#operations-tag-systemInformation'>systemInformation</a> object. Dell will use this information to contact end <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> when errors detected.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>

  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 3: Set proxy server if the <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> wants to configure Integrated Remote Support with a proxy server. This step can be skipped if <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> doesn't want to use proxy server.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>

  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 4: Validate Network connectivity between Integrated Remote Support client and Dell servers.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/checkNetwork <br/>
  { <br/>
  }<br/>

  Following steps are try to get the available sites for the current <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>, select the correct one and set it into Integrated Remote Support client.<br/>
  Step 5: Request for an access code. This access code will be used later to get the available sites.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/requestAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>

  Step 6: Validate the access code.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/validateAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;accessCode&quot; : &quot;243857&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 7: Set siteId. Select the correct site id from the returned sites in previous request.
  <div class='examplebox'>

  at a time. Port with active connection is the Active Port. Unity always uses the primary connection,
  if available. Port with primary connection is the Primary Port. If the primary connection fails,
  Unity automatically switches to one of the standby connections. When the primary connection is
  available again, an FSN automatically switches back to the primary connection.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port,

  NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports
  for hosts to access file-level storage resources.
  NAS servers are independent from each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts
  via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP).
  Storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources,
  such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems.
  <br/>
  Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with
  the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created,
  you can specify the storage <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a> and owning SP - either SPA or SPB.
  <br/>
  In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to
  create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available,
  you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group.
  Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to
  the other SP when there is an SP failure <a href='#operations-tag-event'>event</a>."

  <br/>
  The <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> relies on NTP as a standard for synchronizing the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> clock with
  other nodes on the network. NTP provides a way of synchronizing clocks of
  distributed systems within approximately
  one millisecond of each other. A Windows Active Directory domain controller
  can operate as a time server if the Windows Time Service is running on it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Some applications will not operate correctly if the clock on the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is not
  synchronized with the clock on connected hosts. Configure the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> and any
  connected hosts to use the same time server. Doing so does the following:
  <ul>
  <li>
  Minimizes the chance that synchronization issues will arise between the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>

  </li>
  <li>
  Reduces the difficulty of reconciling timestamps used for log information in
  the different systems.

  Quick Start mode is available when both of these conditions are met:
  <ul>
  <li>No pools exist on the system.</li>
  <li>The <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is not licensed for FAST VP or FAST Cache.</li>
  </ul>

  description: "The preferred interface of NAS server is an interface from which all the non-local outbound connections of this NAS server are initiated.
  The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway).
  <p/>
  The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces
  could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and
  backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:
  <ol>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv6.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):
  <ol>
      <li>Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.</li>
      <li>The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.
  <p/>
  For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed.
  If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting
  (e.g. 'Production/IPv6') gets reset to automatic selection.
  <p/>
  During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden.
  It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from
  the 'override' flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden,
  the interface is kept preferred.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, <a href='#operations-tag-fileInterface_property_isPreferred'>fileInterface.isPreferred</a> == true.

  <br/>
  Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either
  locally or to a remote network device.
  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data
  and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source
  data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case
  the main storage backup <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> fails. As a result, the:

  </ul>

 Use this resource to enable and disable <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> level security settings.
 <br/>
 The settings include:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 a) FIPS 140-2
 <br/>
  Information about whether the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is working in Federal Information
  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the
  storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management
  communication into and out of the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is encrypted using SSL. As a part of
  this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher
  suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the
  allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation
  to those that are sufficiently strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients
  can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not
  support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 b) SSO
  <br/>
  Information about whether the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is participating in Single Sign On mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication
  server for multiple storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>, thus creating a shared authentication domain
  where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> credentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If SSO is enabled, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> will participate in Single Sign On mode,
  and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 c) TLS Mode
  <br/>
  Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS.
  As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use.
  By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications.
 TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol.
 TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol.
  In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the
  supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server."

 The UUID cannot be changed during the <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> life cycle. The asynchronous replication of the NAS servers
 is allowed only between the servers belonging to the tenants with the same UUID.

  <br/>
  The storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> supports third-party anti-virus servers that perform virus scans and
  reports back to the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. For example, when an SMB client creates, moves, or modifies
  a file, the NAS server invokes the anti-virus server to scan the file for known
  viruses. During the scan any access to this file is blocked.
  If the file does not contain a virus, it is written to the file <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>.
  If the file is infected, corrective action (fixed, removed or placed in quarantine) is taken as
  defined by the anti-virus server.
  You can optionally set up the service to scan the file on read access based on last access of the file
  compared to last update of the third-party anti-virus date.
  <br/>
  A <a href='#operations-tag-virusChecker'>virusChecker</a> object is created each time the anti-virus service is enabled on a NAS server.
  A configuration file (named <a href='#operations-tag-virusChecker_property_conf)'>viruschecker.conf)</a> needs to be uploaded on the NAS server before
  enabling the anti-virus service."

  In a GUI it is available on General Settings - 'Link aggregation & FSN' page.
  <p/>
  Fail-Safe Network (FSN) is a high-availability <a href='#operations-tag-feature'>feature</a> that extends link failover into the
  network by providing a switch-level redundancy. An FSN appears as a single link with a single
  MAC address and potentially multiple IP addresses. An FSN can be built from Ethernet Ports and
  non-FSN link aggregations, or combination of them. Only one connection in an FSN is active
  at a time. Port with active connection is the Active Port. Unity always uses the primary connection,
  if available. Port with primary connection is the Primary Port. If the primary connection fails,
  Unity automatically switches to one of the standby connections. When the primary connection is
  available again, an FSN automatically switches back to the primary connection.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port,
  configure them before creating an FSN.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet Ports and link aggregations with the same MTU size
  and not included in another FSN Port.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet Port to FSN if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  The features of an FSN Port are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>FSN component devices do not have to be the same device type. A single FSN Port
  can include Fast Ethernet devices or link aggregations, or a combination of these types,
  all on the same Unity.</li>
  <li>There can be a maximum of four devices in a FSN.</li>
  <li>Only one component device of an FSN Port is active at a time.</li>
  <li>If all the connections in FSN Port fail, the link is down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
  The Unisphere online Help provides more details on FSN configuring."

  A storage resource<b><i> </i></b>is a specific type of storage entity
  allocated in the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> for a particular kind of <a href='#operations-tag-host'>host</a> or application.
  The storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> provides the following types of storage resources:
  <ul>
  <li>LUNs</li>
  <li>Consistency groups</li>
  <li>File systems accessed via NFS and/or CIFS shares.</li>
  <li>VMware NFS datastores</li>
  <li>VMware VMFS datastores</li>
  <li>VVol (file)</li>
  <li>VVol (block)</li>
  </ul>
  All types of storage resource types can be divided into two major groups:
  <ul>
  <li>Block (or <a href='#operations-tag-lun'>LUN</a> based) storage resources: LUNs, consistency groups, VMware VMFS datastores, VVol (block).</li>
  <li>File <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> based storage resources: File systems, VMware NFS datastores, VVol (file).</li>
  </ul>
  In order to create a storage resource, there must be at least one <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a>
  configured on the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. For information about configuring pools, see the help
  topic for the <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a>. To provision file <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> based storage resource

  <p/>
  Link aggregation lets you link Ethernet ports (for example, port 0 and port 1)
  on a Storage Processor (SP) to a single logical port, and therefore lets you
  use up to four Ethernet ports on the SP. If your <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> has two SPs, and you
  link two physical ports, the same ports on both SPs are linked for redundancy.
  For example, if you link port 0 to port 1, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> creates one link
  aggregation for these ports on SPA and another link aggregation on SPB.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports belonging to the same I/O module
  or on-board Ethernet ports. Aggregation of ports from different I/O modules is not allowed.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports with the same MTU size.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  Link aggregation provides the following advantages:
  <ul>
  <li>Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one
  logical port.</li>
  <li>Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network
  traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.</li>
  <li>Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the
  <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> does not lose connectivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note: </b>With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the
  same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that
  uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came
  with your switch should provide more information about using LACP.

  A storage resource<b><i> </i></b>is a specific type of storage entity
  allocated in the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> for a particular kind of <a href='#operations-tag-host'>host</a> or application.
  The storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> provides the following types of storage resources:
  <ul>
  <li>LUNs</li>
  <li>Consistency groups</li>
  <li>File systems accessed via NFS and/or CIFS shares.</li>
  <li>VMware NFS datastores</li>
  <li>VMware VMFS datastores</li>
  <li>VVol (file)</li>
  <li>VVol (block)</li>
  </ul>
  All types of storage resource types can be divided into two major groups:
  <ul>
  <li>Block (or <a href='#operations-tag-lun'>LUN</a> based) storage resources: LUNs, consistency groups, VMware VMFS datastores, VVol (block).</li>
  <li>File <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> based storage resources: File systems, VMware NFS datastores, VVol (file).</li>
  </ul>
  In order to create a storage resource, there must be at least one <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a>
  configured on the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. For information about configuring pools, see the help
  topic for the <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a>. To provision file <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> based storage resource

OpenVMS requires an unique OVMS device UUID for every device visible to an OVMS <a href='#operations-tag-host'>host</a>, the OVMS device UUID must also be consistent for any given device across all nodes of an OVMS cluster. Dell VNX and Unity systems create the OVMS device UUID by appending the <a href='#operations-tag-lun'>LUN</a> number to the configured Unity or VNX OVMS base UUID. In the situation of multiple storage systems visible to the same OVMS host(s) the storage systems must be configured with unique values which avoid conflicting OVMS device UUIDs. Unity and VNX devices connected to multi-node OVMS clusters should be configured into a consistency group to ensure a consistent OVMS device UUID for the same device across all OVMS cluster nodes."

  <p/>
  A Domain Name <a href='#operations-tag-system'>System</a> (DNS) is a hierarchical <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> responsible for converting
  domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> uses DNS services
  to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs
  (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts
  addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.
  <p/>
  During the initial <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> configuration process you must specify the network
  address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses.
  Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.
  <p/>
  You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP
  address of the DNS servers for the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> to use. By default, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> uses
  the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list
  provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes
  unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the
  <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also
  specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>
  will use first.
  <p/>
  DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is
  identified by a domain identifier.
  <p/>
  <b>Important:</b> You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in
  the domain for the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt
  network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt

    description: "Information about the EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS) configuration<br/>
  <br/>
  Unity Remote Support is enabled with the Dell&#8217;s leading remote
  support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote
  monitoring and support
  <a href='#operations-tag-feature'>feature</a> that provides authorized personnel with Dell remote access capabilities
  to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure
  tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> and
  systems on the Dell network can be used to transfer files out
  to the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> or back to Dell.<br/>
  <br/>
  ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end
  remote support solution:<br/>
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Automation - IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis
  and repair of potential problems before an impact to business
  operations is noticed.</li>
  <li>Authentication - Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit
  <a href='#operations-tag-encryption'>encryption</a> and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.</li>
  <li>Authorization - Customizable policies that you control include
  the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions.</li>
  <li>Audit - Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory
  and internal business requirements.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  ESRS offers two remote support solutions:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated
  into the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> to connect with Dell</li>
  <li>Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition
  (ESRS V3) to connect with Dell</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Setting up Remote Support requires:
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>An installed Dell Support <a href='#operations-tag-license'>license</a></li>
  <li>Valid support credentials</li>
  <li>A configured DNS server</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the
  support website.<br/>
  Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the <a href='#operations-tag-supportProxy'>supportProxy</a>
  object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName
   are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  <b>Series operations need to perform to enable Integrated Remote Support</b><br/>
  <br/>
  Step 1: Accept EULA. The EULA must be accepted before any other configurations.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;isEsrsVeEulaAccepted&quot; : &quot;true&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 2: Update contact infomation in <a href='#operations-tag-systemInformation'>systemInformation</a> object. Dell will use this information to contact end <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> when errors detected.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/systemInformation/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;contactFirstName&quot; : &quot;Jill&quot;,<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;contactLastName&quot; : &quot;Valentine&quot;,<br/>

  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 3: Set proxy server if the <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> wants to configure Integrated Remote Support with a proxy server. This step can be skipped if <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> doesn't want to use proxy server.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/supportProxy/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>

  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 4: Validate Network connectivity between Integrated Remote Support client and Dell servers.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/checkNetwork <br/>
  { <br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Following steps are try to get the available sites for the current <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>, select the correct one and set it into Integrated Remote Support client.<br/>
  Step 5: Request for an access code. This access code will be used later to get the available sites.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/requestAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 6: Validate the access code.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/validateAccessCode <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;accessCode&quot; : &quot;243857&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 7: Set siteId. Select the correct site id from the returned sites in previous request.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;enabled&quot; : &quot;true&quot;,<br/>

 Currently there three types of relocations supported:
 <br/>
 <li>Scheduled relocations</li>
 <li>Manual relocations</li>
 <li>Rebalancing</li>
 <br/>
 Scheduled relocations are started according the schedule defined in this resource. Individual pools can be included to
 or excluded from the scheduled relocation process.
 <br/>
 Manual relocations can be performed on demand for each particular <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a>.
 <br/>
 Rebalancing is performed automatically on a <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a> extend <a href='#operations-tag-event'>event</a>.
 <br/>
 The FAST VP object represents the status of scheduled relocation processes and allows to view or modify the scheduled relocation parameters.

  The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) provides a standard for backing up file

  Storage systems support NDMP v2-v4 over the network. Direct-attach NDMP is not supported.
  This means that the tape drives need to be connected to a media server, and the NAS server
  communicates with the media server over the network. NDMP has an advantage when using

  In a GUI it is available on General Settings - 'Link aggregation & FSN' page.
  <p/>
  Fail-Safe Network (FSN) is a high-availability <a href='#operations-tag-feature'>feature</a> that extends link failover into the
  network by providing a switch-level redundancy. An FSN appears as a single link with a single
  MAC address and potentially multiple IP addresses. An FSN can be built from Ethernet Ports and
  non-FSN link aggregations, or combination of them. Only one connection in an FSN is active
  at a time. Port with active connection is the Active Port. Unity always uses the primary connection,
  if available. Port with primary connection is the Primary Port. If the primary connection fails,
  Unity automatically switches to one of the standby connections. When the primary connection is
  available again, an FSN automatically switches back to the primary connection.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port,
  configure them before creating an FSN.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet Ports and link aggregations with the same MTU size
  and not included in another FSN Port.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet Port to FSN if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  The features of an FSN Port are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>FSN component devices do not have to be the same device type. A single FSN Port
  can include Fast Ethernet devices or link aggregations, or a combination of these types,
  all on the same Unity.</li>
  <li>There can be a maximum of four devices in a FSN.</li>
  <li>Only one component device of an FSN Port is active at a time.</li>
  <li>If all the connections in FSN Port fail, the link is down.</li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
  The Unisphere online Help provides more details on FSN configuring."

  linkAggregation:
    type: object
    description: "(Applies if link aggregation is supported.) Ethernet port link aggregation settings.
  <p/>
  Link aggregation lets you link Ethernet ports (for example, port 0 and port 1)
  on a Storage Processor (SP) to a single logical port, and therefore lets you
  use up to four Ethernet ports on the SP. If your <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> has two SPs, and you
  link two physical ports, the same ports on both SPs are linked for redundancy.
  For example, if you link port 0 to port 1, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> creates one link
  aggregation for these ports on SPA and another link aggregation on SPB.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports belonging to the same I/O module
  or on-board Ethernet ports. Aggregation of ports from different I/O modules is not allowed.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can aggregate only Ethernet ports with the same MTU size.
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.
  <p/>
  Link aggregation provides the following advantages:
  <ul>
  <li>Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one
  logical port.</li>
  <li>Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network
  traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.</li>
  <li>Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the
  <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> does not lose connectivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note: </b>With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the
  same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that
  uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came
  with your switch should provide more information about using LACP.
  <p/>
  The Unisphere online Help provides more details on cabling the SPs to the
  Disk-Array Enclosures (DAEs)."

  <br/>
  NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports
  for hosts to access file-level storage resources.
  NAS servers are independent from each other.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts
  via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP).
  Storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources,
  such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems.
  <br/>
  Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with
  the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created,
  you can specify the storage <a href='#operations-tag-pool'>pool</a> and owning SP - either SPA or SPB.
  <br/>
  In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to
  create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available,
  you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group.
  Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to
  the other SP when there is an SP failure <a href='#operations-tag-event'>event</a>."

    description: "The preferred interface of NAS server is an interface from which all the non-local outbound connections of this NAS server are initiated.
  The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway).
  <p/>
  The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces
  could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and
  backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:
  <ol>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces, IPv6.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.</li>
      <li>Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):
  <ol>
      <li>Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.</li>
      <li>Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.</li>
      <li>The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.</li>
      <li>From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.</li>
  </ol>
  <p/>
  <b>Note: </b>During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.
  <p/>
  For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed.
  If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting
  (e.g. 'Production/IPv6') gets reset to automatic selection.
  <p/>
  During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden.
  It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from
  the 'override' flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden,
  the interface is kept preferred.
  <p/>
  The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, <a href='#operations-tag-fileInterface_property_isPreferred'>fileInterface.isPreferred</a> == true.

  Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either
  locally or to a remote network device.
  Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data
  and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source
  data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case
  the main storage backup <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> fails. As a result, the:
  <ul>
  <li>Downtime associated cost of a <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> failure is minimized.
  <li>Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.
  </ul>
  A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a replication
  operation between a source and a destination. The replication source and
  destination may be local or remote. The session establishes the path that
  the data follows as it moves from source to destination."

 <br/>
 Use this resource to enable and disable <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> level security settings.
 <br/>
 The settings include:
 <br/>
 <br/>
 a) FIPS 140-2
 <br/>
  Information about whether the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is working in Federal Information
  Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the
  storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management
  communication into and out of the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is encrypted using SSL. As a part of
  this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher
  suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the
  allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation
  to those that are sufficiently strong.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients
  can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not
  support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 b) SSO
  <br/>
  Information about whether the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> is participating in Single Sign On mode.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication
  server for multiple storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>, thus creating a shared authentication domain
  where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> credentials.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If SSO is enabled, the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> will participate in Single Sign On mode,
  and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

  <br/>
  <br/>
 c) TLS Mode
  <br/>
  Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS.
  As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use.
  By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications.
 TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol.
 TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol.
  In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the
  supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server."

  <br/>
  <a href='#operations-tag-supportAssist'>SupportAssist</a> is a remote monitoring and support <a href='#operations-tag-feature'>feature</a> that provides authorized
  personnel with DELL remote access capabilities
  to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure
  tunnel that <a href='#operations-tag-supportAssist'>SupportAssist</a> establishes between the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> and
  systems on the DELL network can be used to transfer files (like upgrade image)
  out to the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> or back to DELL.<br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Setting up <a href='#operations-tag-supportAssist'>SupportAssist</a> requires:
  <br/>
  <ul>
  <li>An installed DELL Support <a href='#operations-tag-license'>license</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br/>

  <b>Operations need to perform to enable <a href='#operations-tag-supportAssist'>SupportAssist</a></b><br/>
  <br/>
  Step 1: Accept EULA. The EULA must be accepted before or at the same time as any other
     configurations.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>
  POST /api/instances/supportAssist/0/action/modify <br/>
  { <br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;isEULAAccepted&quot; : &quot;true&quot;<br/>
  }<br/>
  </p>
  </div>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Step 2: Initialize Connection [Optional]. If <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> didn't enable ESRS in old version,
     after upgrading to new version, the initialization operation must be performed before enabling Connection.
  <div class='examplebox'>
  <p>

 and gets the independent and exclusive access to certain storage resources.
 On the storage array, it corresponds to a NAS server group with an independent IP addressing.
 At the moment, iSCSI and management resources do not support multi-tenant access.

 For each <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> a corresponding Linux network namespace is created. In the current design,
 traffic separation between the tenants is done by the VLANs. Each <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> reserves a group of VLANs,
 and each VLAN can belong to one <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> maximum. Every <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> gets a name and the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).
 The UUID cannot be changed during the <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> life cycle. The asynchronous replication of the NAS servers
 is allowed only between the servers belonging to the tenants with the same UUID.

 The NAS servers and VLANs can still belong to no <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a>. Such NAS servers and VLANs operate
 in the Linux base network namespace, together with management and iSCSI interfaces.

 The control stack of the <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> does not allow <a href='#operations-tag-user'>user</a> to log in in the <a href='#operations-tag-tenant'>tenant</a> administrator <a href='#operations-tag-role'>role</a>.
 All the tenants, NAS servers and VLANs are managed from the single <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> administrator account.
 To allow this, the corresponding GUI and CLI modifications are made."

  The storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a> supports third-party anti-virus servers that perform virus scans and
  reports back to the storage <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>. For example, when an SMB client creates, moves, or modifies
  a file, the NAS server invokes the anti-virus server to scan the file for known
  viruses. During the scan any access to this file is blocked.
  If the file does not contain a virus, it is written to the file <a href='#operations-tag-system'>system</a>.
  If the file is infected, corrective action (fixed, removed or placed in quarantine) is taken as
  defined by the anti-virus server.
  You can optionally set up the service to scan the file on read access based on last access of the file
  compared to last update of the third-party anti-virus date.
  <br/>
  A <a href='#operations-tag-virusChecker'>virusChecker</a> object is created each time the anti-virus service is enabled on a NAS server.
